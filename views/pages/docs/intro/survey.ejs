    <h2>A16Z AI Survey Goals</h2>
    <p>Our goals with this survey were threefold. We intended to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>gather knowledge on a representative but not exhaustive set new services that are emerging and understand what they are (or aren't) good for, and how they relate/compare to/complement each other when possible, and
      <li>package this knowledge in easily accessible form and thus help others who may not be deeply technical (or may not have the time) get a sense of where the AI/ML space is now, and by doing that
      <li>serve as a starting point for more detailed work or analysis
    </ul>
    <h2>Relevancy</h2>
    <p>Breaking news: Technology moves fast. We know this as well as anyone,
      and so we embark on this project with full knowledge that in just a few
      months there will be new and better APIs, services, even new languages
      and platforms to usee, understand, play and build the future with. We
      intend this survey to be a useful guide for as long as possible, yes, but
    we have no plans to update it frequently or keep it "up to date" with the latest
    developments.</p>
    <P>In summary, to the question: "How often will this survey be updated?" our
      tentative answer is: "Never."</p>
    <p>Instead, imagine it both as a useful starting point and as a time capsule that
    is most accurate when placed with its center around the Fall/Winter of 2016. For readers from the
    far future in which the decimal system has been banned by a race of super-intelligent
    lobsters, that would be the year when the iPhone got THREE cameras, because reasons.</p>
    <h2>Technologies used</h2>
    <P>Before we begin, it's important to underscore the following: the fact
      that certain technologies, languages, services, systems, etc. are used in
      this survey as examples is in no way intended as an endorsement of any kind
      by Andreesssen-Horowitz or any of its partners or companies.</p>
    <P>[TODO cleanup]
    <P>We focused on web technologies.
    <P>We wanted to provide real(ish)-world examples, something that was easy
      to understand and relate to for a lot of people.
      To be able to see this sample code running and have others be able
      to run it as well as experiment with it, and
      for that a web platform was a natural choice. In some cases APIs can
      use more advanced features for local apps
      (e.g. IBM's Watson supports Streaming Speech recognition with their iOS
      SDK) but running those samples would be much more complex and provide
      less insight for the relative cost.</p>
      <h2>Language/Platform</h2>
        <P>We selected JavaScript and Node.js as language and platform respectively.
         Put away your pitchforks! We understand JS/Node.js has its fans as well as its detractors,
         and often someone can be both! What's undeniable is that JavaScript is
         both universally available
         in both clients and servers as well as being fairly well known.
         We love Python, Java, Scala, Go, Haskell, ML, Prolog,
         APL, and many others (well, maybe not APL.) but for most of the sample
         code here we'll use JavaScript and that is that.</p>
         <P>CSS and styles: <a href="http://getbootstrap.com" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>.</p>
      <h2>Runtime</h2>
      For runtime platform we chose Heroku, primarily because it is a "neutral"
      provider of cloud runtime services. Other providers (e.g. Google,
      Microsoft, Amazon) also have their own AI/ML APIs and services and
      support different (usually easier) integrations between these services
      and their own platforms. Using a separate 3rd party service puts everyone
      on a level playing field. Additionally, Heroku supports multiple languages
      and has a free tier, which will allow people to clone and run this project
      without problems if needed.
      <P>
      And so we begin. Eyes up, Guardian.
