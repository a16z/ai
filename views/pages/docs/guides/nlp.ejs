    <h1>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</h1>
    <p>NLP is a fundamental technology in the area of human-computer interaction.</p>
    <p>Key areas of NLP include understanding/processing language, translation, and language generation.</p>
    <p><b>Understanding</b> enables computers to derive meaning from language input
        and possibly act on it.</p>
        <p>There are many degrees of "understanding" that
        can be achieved, from analyzing the sentiment behind a phrase or text to extracting information, disambiguating, or
      understanding the actual meaning.</p>
      <h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>
      <p>For example, the following sentences:</p>
         <ul>
           <li>"The F-117 Nighthawk is cool."</li>
           <li>"Airplanes are cool."</li>
           <li>"Seeing a hawk at night is cool."</li>
         </ul>
         <p>Have all different meanings but communicate a similar feeling, or <i>sentiment</i>.
        <p>Understanding sentiment without understanding meaning can be
          extremely useful. For example, a system can monitor conversations of
          customers with technical support and derive a general degree of
          "happiness", "anger" or other emotions expressed in the communication.
        It may not be useful or necessarily extremely precise for a single sentence or a single person,
        but they can be very useful and precise when agregating conversations
      or many different calls.</p>
       </p>
      <p><b>Generating language</b> allows a computer to interact with humans in their own language.
        Generating spoken language is a function generally called <i>Speech Synthesis</i>.
        It's important to note that <i>understanding</i> speech or language is not required for generating it.</p>
      <p>Understanding spoken language is a large field in and of itself, and it's what is typically referred to as <i>Speech Recognition<i>.</p>
      <p><b>Translating between languages</b> may or may not involve understanding, and may also involve different degrees of flexibility.</p>
    </ul>
