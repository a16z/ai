    <h1>Pattern Recognition</h1>
    <p>Recognizing patterns, which does not imply <i>understanding</i> of the
      patterns that are recognized, is a critical component of intelligent
      systems.
      <p>Pattern recognition deals with the classification and correlation
        of data, irrespective (as opposed to regardless) of its meaning.</p>
        <p>Classification can occur based on previously defined categories
          presented to the computer system as a <i>training set</i>, in which
          case it is called <i>supervised learning</i>. If no training set
          is provided it's called <i>unsupervised learning</i> and the system
          defines patterns by itself (the <i>meaning<i> of those pattern is
            an entirely different matter.)</p>
      <p>There are many types of algorithms that can be used to derive
        patterns from data: probabilistic/statistical, clustering/structural,
        or neural networks, genetic algorithms, regression, etc. [TODO verify categories/expand]</p>
        <h2>Recognition vs. Understanding</h2>
        A neural net, for example, can be 'taught' to recognize a cat on a JPEG. This is not the same as knowing
        what a cat is, or even being able to recognize a cat on an image stored in a different
        file format.</p>
