    <h1>Other Areas</h1>
    <p>[TODO] We have not defined what work (if any) we'll do in these areas. For now we keep these here for reference. May be removed entirely.</p>

    <h2>Planning and navigation</h2>
    <p>How to get from A to B, "safe" routes. Multiple path selection and optimization. </p>

    <h2>Knowledge Representation</h2>
    <p>Represent information about the world in actionable, and to whatever degree possible, "objective," form, so that systems can reason about it.</p>
    <P>For example: "The sky is blue" is not actionable or objective. "The sky has a color that humans refer to as blue." is a bit better. But still leaves out a lot of ideas (what's a color, what's a human, etc.)</p>
      <p>Minimal discussion of systems like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyc">Cyc</a> would be useful here for reference purposes.</p>
