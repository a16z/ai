    <h1>Vision/Perception</h1>
    <p>While we could define AI areas for the different senses it
      is <i>vision</i> that is a primary area of focus. Sound (sound in
      general, not speech), touch, smell and taste all have seen some work <br>[TODO REFERENCES]<br>
    but it's vision that has been a key rea of focus for a long time. The idea is to extract/create symbols from the raw visual data and then
    use those symbols to make decisions, take actions or produce information.</p>
    <p>Computer vision tasks include processing and analyzing images in
       digital form. In software, digital representation dictates that
      a system that is good at processing still images may not be good at processing movement.
      Sub-domains of computer vision include scene reconstruction,
      motion/event detection, tracking, object recognition, and image restoration
      among many others.
