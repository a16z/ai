# Other Areas

    [TODO] We have not defined what work (if any) we'll do in these areas.
    For now we keep these here for reference. May be removed entirely.

## Planning and navigation

How to get from A to B, "safe" routes. Multiple path selection and optimization.

## Knowledge Representation

Represent information about the world in actionable, and to whatever
degree possible, "objective," form, so that systems can reason about it.
For example: "The sky is blue" is not actionable or objective. "The sky has
a color that humans refer to as blue." is a bit better. But still leaves
out a lot of ideas (what's a color, what's a human, etc.)</p>

Minimal discussion of systems like [Cyc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyc)
would be useful here for reference purposes.
