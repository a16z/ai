# AI Intro

Today, we regularly interact with robots that can clean (e.g., Roomba) or entertain (e.g., Cozmo). Universities and companies around the world have advanced prototypes in place that include everything from self-driving cars to autonomous combat robots.

AI got its start almost as soon as Computer Science, and one could argue that the evolution of AI, with its ups and downs, has actually followed the evolution of computing pretty closely. The pioneers of computing turned their sights on AI almost immediately, and while grand claims have invariably given way to modest accomplishments, we have already advanced past the point we originally set our sights on.

Al encompasses many "subfields", ranging from the general, like vision, learning and perception, to the specific, such as playing complex board games like Chess or Go, proving mathematical theorems, writing music, or diagnosing diseases.
