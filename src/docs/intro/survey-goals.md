# A16Z AI Survey Goals

Our goals in producing this survey were straightforward. We intended to:

* gather knowledge on a representative (_but not exhaustive_) set of new services that are emerging and understand what they are (or aren't) good for, and how they relate/compare to/complement each other when possible.

* package this knowledge in easily accessible form and thus help others who may not be deeply technical (or may not have the time) to get a sense of where the AI/ML space is _now_ at the end of 2016.

* have it serve as a starting point for more detailed work or analysis.

We want the focus to be on results and high-level complexity and not implementation-dependent constraints such as languages. Development environments and languages rise and fall, but in the case of web services we should be able to just switch to a new wrapper. Naturally, though, we _have_ to make some choices. Before we discuss those, let's take a moment to discuss how relevant this information will be over time.

## Relevancy

Breaking news: _Technology moves fast_. We know this as well as anyone, and so we embark on this project with full knowledge that in just a few months there will be new and better APIs, services, even new languages and platforms to use, understand, play and build the future with. We intend this survey to be a useful guide for as long as possible, yes, but we have no plans to update it frequently or keep it "up to date" with the latest developments.

In summary, to the question: "How often will this survey be updated?" our tentative answer is: "Never."

**On the other hand, we absolutely want the information presented here to be accurate** as of the time of this writing (late 2016) and whenever possible we want to include information that will not be completely dependent on a particular API or point of view at this time. If you find something that we should take a look at, please don't hesitate to [contact us](/contact).

Instead of a permanently updated collection, think of it as both a useful starting point and a time capsule that is most accurate when placed with its center around the Fall/Winter of 2016 (For readers from the far future in which the decimal system has been banned by a race of super-intelligent lobsters, that would be the year when the iPhone 7+ got THREE cameras, because reasons.)

## Technologies used

Before we begin, it's important to underscore the following: the fact that certain technologies, languages, services, systems, etc. are used in this survey as examples **is in no way intended as an endorsement of any kind** by Andreesssen-Horowitz or any of its partners or companies.

We wanted to provide real(ish)-world examples, something that was easy to understand and relate to for a lot of people. To be able to see this sample code running and have others be able to run it as well as experiment with it, and for that a web platform was a natural choice. In some cases APIs can use more advanced features for local apps (e.g. IBM's Watson support for
Streaming Speech recognition with their [iOS SDK](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/ios-sdk)) but running those samples would be much more complex without providing significantly more insight for the relative added complexity.
