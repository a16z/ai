# A16Z AI Survey: Getting started

More than a decade into the mobile revolution and the growth of cloud computing, we are faced with a demand for new approaches to analyze, classify, and react to data.

Simple rule-based systems that used to be fine to generate activity feeds, separate acceptable content from that which is not allowed, or to analyze trends are reaching their natural limits of efficiency. Software that calls itself 'smart' is giving way to software that actually is.

Luckily, the same technological environment that has created the demand for intelligent systems has also provided the tools and systems to push Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning forward.

The field of AI/ML continues to advance at a steady pace pace, but we hope that this survey will provide a reasonable reflection of its state in late 2016.

The content is divided into sections which are (individually) a relatively quick read.

For details on the survey, you can start with the [survey goals](/docs/intro/survey-goals) and a brief [introduction to AI](/docts/intro/ai).

We have divided content into top-level categories for easier browsing: such as [Natural Language Processing](/docs/guides/nlp), [Vision](/docs/guides/vision), or [Deep Learning](/docs/intro/dl).

Whenever possible we have included live examples throughout the various sections. We also encourage you to fork the github repository and experiment! Most APIs are easy to setup and include free tiers for experimentation.
