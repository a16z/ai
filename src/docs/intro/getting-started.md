# A16Z AI Survey: Getting started

Thanks for taking the time to read our AI Survey!

The field of AI/ML continues to advance at a steady pace pace, but we hope that this survey will provide a reasonable reflection of its state in late 2016.

The content is divided into sections which are (individually) a relatively quick read.

For details on the survey, you can start with the [survey goals](/docs/intro/survey-goals) and a brief [introduction to AI](/docts/intro/ai).

We have divided content into top-level categories for easier browsing: such as [Natural Language Processing](/docs/guides/nlp), [Vision](/docs/guides/vision), or [Deep Learning](/docs/intro/dl).

Whenever possible we have included live examples throughout the various sections. We also encourage you to fork the github repository and experiment! Most APIs are easy to setup and include free tiers for experimentation.
