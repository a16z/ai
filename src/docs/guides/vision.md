# Vision/Perception

While we could define AI areas for the different senses it is _vision_ that is a primary area of focus. Sound (sound in general, not speech), touch, smell and taste all have seen some work -- but it's vision that has been a key area of focus for a long time. The idea is to extract/create symbols from the raw visual data and then use those symbols to make decisions, take actions or produce information.

Computer vision tasks include processing and analyzing images in digital form. In software, digital representation dictates that a system that is good at processing still images may not be good at processing movement.

Sub-domains of computer vision include scene reconstruction, motion/event detection, tracking, object recognition, and image restoration among many others.
