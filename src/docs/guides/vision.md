Vision/Perception

While we could define AI areas for the different senses it is <i>vision</i>
that is a primary area of focus. Sound (sound in general, not speech), touch,
smell and taste all have seen some work

but it's vision that has been a key rea of focus for a long time. The idea
is to extract/create symbols from the raw visual data and then use those
symbols to make decisions, take actions or produce information.

Computer vision tasks include processing and analyzing images in
 digital form. In software, digital representation dictates that a system
 that is good at processing still images may not be good at processing movement.

 Sub-domains of computer vision include scene reconstruction, motion/event
 detection, tracking, object recognition, and image restoration among
 many others.
