# Natural Language Processing (NLP)

NLP is a fundamental technology in the area of human-computer interaction.

Key areas of NLP include understanding/processing language, translation,
and language generation.

**Understanding** enables computers to derive meaning from language input
and possibly act on it.

There are many degrees of "understanding" that can be achieved, from analyzing
the sentiment behind a phrase or text to extracting information,
disambiguating, or understanding the actual meaning.</p>

## Sentiment Analysis

For example, the following sentences:

* "The F-117 Nighthawk is cool."
* "Airplanes are cool."
* "Seeing a hawk at night is cool."

Have all different meanings but communicate a similar feeling, or _sentiment_.
Understanding sentiment without understanding meaning can be extremely
useful. For example, a system can monitor conversations of customers with
technical support and derive a general degree of "happiness", "anger" or
other emotions expressed in the communication.

It may not be useful or necessarily extremely precise for a single sentence
or a single person, but they can be very useful and precise when aggregating
conversations or many different calls.

**Generating language** allows a computer to interact with humans in their own
language. Generating spoken language is generally called _Speech Synthesis_.

It's important to note that _understanding_ speech or language is not
required for generating it.

Understanding spoken language is a large field in and of itself, and it's
what is typically referred to as _Speech Recognition_.

**Translating between languages** may or may not involve understanding, and
may also involve different degrees of flexibility.
