# Other Areas

[TODO] We have not defined what work (if any) we'll do in these areas. For now we keep these here for reference. May be removed entirely.

## Planning and navigation

How to get from A to B, "safe" routes. Multiple path selection and optimization.

## Knowledge Representation

Represent information about the world in actionable, and to whatever
degree possible, "objective," form, so that systems can reason about it.

For example: "The sky is blue" is neither actionable nor objective. "The
sky's color is identified by humans as blue'." is a bit better. But
still leaves out a lot of ideas (what's a color, what's a human, etc.)

Minimal discussion of systems like
[Cyc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyc)</a> would be useful here for
 reference purposes.

## Recognition vs. Understanding

 A neural net, for example, can be 'taught' to recognize a cat on a JPEG.
 This is not the same as knowing what a cat is, or even being able
 to recognize a cat on an image stored in a different file format.

# Pattern Recognition

Recognizing patterns, which does not imply _understanding_ of the patterns
that are recognized, is a critical component of intelligent systems.

Pattern recognition deals with the classification and correlation of data,
irrespective (as opposed to regardless) of its meaning.

Classification can occur based on previously defined categories presented
to the computer system as a _training set_, in which case it is
called _supervised learning_. If no training set is provided
it's called _unsupervised learning_ and the system defines patterns
by itself (the _meaning_ of those pattern is an entirely different
matter.)

This field, in particular that of neural networks, has been at the center
of a quantitative leap in pattern recognition, classification, and related
tasks, with a set of techniques commonly referred to as Deep Learning.
