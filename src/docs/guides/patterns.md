# Pattern Recognition

Recognizing patterns, which does not imply _understanding_ of the patterns
 that are recognized, is a critical component of intelligent systems.

 Pattern recognition deals with the classification and correlation of data,
 irrespective (as opposed to regardless) of its meaning.

 Classification can occur based on previously defined categories presented
 to the computer system as a _training set_, in which case it is
 called _supervised learning_. If no training set is provided
 it's called _unsupervised learning_ and the system defines patterns
 by itself (the _meaning_ of those pattern is an entirely different
matter.)

There are many types of algorithms that can be used to derive patterns
from data: probabilistic/statistical, clustering/structural, or neural 
networks, genetic algorithms, regression, etc. [TODO verify categories/expand]

## Recognition vs. Understanding

 A neural net, for example, can be 'taught' to recognize a cat on a JPEG.
 This is not the same as knowing what a cat is, or even being able
 to recognize a cat on an image stored in a different file format.
