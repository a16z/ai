## Watson/Bluemix/AlchemyAPI

Bluemix Docs: https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#

Guide for node at the package source and credentials
https://www.npmjs.com/package/watson-developer-cloud

install  node
$ npm install watson-developer-cloud --save

get credentials
go to https://console.ng.bluemix.net
sign up
(“Your 30-day trial is free, with no credit card required. You get access to 2 GB of runtime and container memory to run apps, unlimited IBM services and APIs, and complimentary support.”)

Registered
Then says: “Thanks! Check your email for next steps
no email arrives
trying to login sends you to id iam.ibm.com
nothing happens, dots appear on screen

had to re-signup
make sure you CLICK on the arrow shown in watson-bluemix.img.1.png so that you get to the screen state shown in watson-bluemix.img.2.png

signup is all through bluemix.net
but sign in is through iam.ibm.com
?!?!?

Create organization: choose from US South, Sydney, UK
?!?
presumably sydney is australia uh?
for suggestion of org name it tells me to use my first name or email?!?

then it needs a ‘space’

then ‘ready?’
watson-bluemix-signup2.img.4.png

took me literally 30 minutes to go from “signup” to looking at the first screen 
watson-bluemix-signup3.img.5.png

so… 30 min later… “ok where the hell was I?”

On the bluemix “console” click on “catalog” then scroll through a million things
then choose ‘Tone Analyzer’

Space: test
App Leave unbound
*Service name:* ai-sentiment-watson
*Credential name:* ai-sentiment-watson-cred
(see watson-bluemix.img.6.png)

Loads into watson-bluemix.img.7.png

Then Service credentials. Big button that says “add credentials” but you already have them there!
something like:
{
  "credentials": {
    "url": "https://gateway.watsonplatform.net/tone-analyzer/api",
    "password": “xxxxxxxx”,
    "username": “xxxxxxx-f171-45f2-af11-9caecc3c2cb3"
  }
}

Aha! but now it turns out that AlchemyAPI ALSO has a sentiment analysis thingy

so create a service for AlchemyAPI (separate from Tone Analysis we just did)

Space: test
App Leave unbound
*Service name:* ai-alchemy-watson
*Credential name:* ai-alchemy-watson-cred
(see watson-bluemix.img.8.png)


we’ll do both at once
need to register the following vars in your local environment
(through shell) and in the heroku runtime (choose app > Settings > Config Vars)
export IBM_WATSON_TONE_USERNAME=xxxxxx
export IBM_WATSON_TONE_PASSWORD=xxxxx
export IBM_ALCHEMY_API_KEY=xxxxxxx
