# About this folder

This folder and its subfolders contain (generally) structured data used
to load and identify services, as well as data used in pages that provide
sample content to use for tests.

## Is it data or data and config files?

Some of this data would generally be considered _configuration_ data/info
but in this case it's useful to keep it somewhat separate as data that can
be used since providing quick information on how to setup/use certain APIs
is part of what this survey is about.

## Formats

All the structured/text data in this folder tree is stored in JSON files
encoded in UTF-8. The schema of the files is not based on standards since for
the most part, for these types of data/config, there aren't any.

Note: if we have overlooked the use of a standard, or want to send any comments,
suggestions, or corrections on this topic please don't hesitate to (contact us)[/contact/].

## Ownership and Licensing

Unless otherwise noted, the data was collected and structured during the
development/writing of this survey and, unless otherwise noted, follows
the same licenses as for other content+code on this project.
