# Custom Bootstrap Directory

To further customize the design of this site, we use the [standard bootstrap customization page](http://getbootstrap.com/customize/). There are three ways of accessing the current configuration to modify it:

* Upload the `config.json` file in this directory to the customization page (also saved as a gist at [https://gist.github.com/2313e16c0351334850f523b2ea5d99a0](https://gist.github.com/2313e16c0351334850f523b2ea5d99a0))
* Directly access the configuration at [http://getbootstrap.com/customize/?id=2313e16c0351334850f523b2ea5d99a0](http://getbootstrap.com/customize/?id=2313e16c0351334850f523b2ea5d99a0)

Once you have downloaded a new package zipfile, uncompress and extract to this directory, then redeploy.
